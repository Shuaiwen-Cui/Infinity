The /teleop_turtle node is publishing data (the keystrokes you enter to move the turtle around) to the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, and the /turtlesim node is subscribed to that topic to receive the data.</p> <p>The highlighting feature of rqt_graph is very helpful when examining more complex systems with many nodes and topics connected in many different ways.</p> <p>rqt_graph is a graphical introspection tool. Now we\u2019ll look at some command line tools for introspecting topics.</p> <p>3 ros2 topic list</p> <p>Running the ros2 topic list command in a new terminal will return a list of all the topics currently active in the system:</p> <p><pre><code>/parameter_events\n/rosout\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\n/turtle1/color_sensor\n/turtle1/pose\n</code></pre> ros2 topic list -t will return the same list of topics, this time with the topic type appended in brackets:</p> <p><pre><code>/parameter_events [rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent]\n/rosout [rcl_interfaces/msg/Log]\n/turtle1/cmd_vel [geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]\n/turtle1/color_sensor [turtlesim/msg/Color]\n/turtle1/pose [turtlesim/msg/Pose]\n</code></pre> These attributes, particularly the type, are how nodes know they\u2019re talking about the same information as it moves over topics.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering where all these topics are in rqt_graph, you can uncheck all the boxes under Hide:</p> <p>For now, though, leave those options checked to avoid confusion.</p> <p>ros2 topic echo</p> <p>To see the data being published on a topic, use:</p> <pre><code>ros2 topic echo &lt;topic_name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Since we know that /teleop_turtle publishes data to /turtlesim over the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, let\u2019s use echo to introspect that topic:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel\n</code></pre> At first, this command won\u2019t return any data. That\u2019s because it\u2019s waiting for /teleop_turtle to publish something.</p> <p>Return to the terminal where turtle_teleop_key is running and use the arrows to move the turtle around. Watch the terminal where your echo is running at the same time, and you\u2019ll see position data being published for every movement you make:</p> <pre><code>linear:\n  x: 2.0\n  y: 0.0\n  z: 0.0\nangular:\n  x: 0.0\n  y: 0.0\n  z: 0.0\n  ---\n</code></pre> <p>/_ros2cli_26646 is the node created by the echo command we just ran (the number might be different). Now you can see that the publisher is publishing data over the cmd_vel topic, and two subscribers are subscribed to it.</p> <p>ros2 topic info</p> <p>Topics don\u2019t have to only be one-to-one communication; they can be one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.</p> <p>Another way to look at this is running:</p> <pre><code>ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel\n</code></pre> <p>Which will return:</p> <pre><code>Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\nPublisher count: 1\nSubscription count: 2\n</code></pre> <p>6 ros2 interface show</p> <p>Nodes send data over topics using messages. Publishers and subscribers must send and receive the same type of message to communicate.</p> <p>The topic types we saw earlier after running ros2 topic list -t let us know what message type is used on each topic. Recall that the cmd_vel topic has the type:</p> <pre><code>geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\n</code></pre> <p>This means that in the package geometry_msgs there is a msg called Twist.</p> <p>Now we can run ros2 interface show  on this type to learn its details. Specifically, what structure of data the message expects. <p><pre><code>ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\n</code></pre> For the message type from above it yields:</p> <pre><code># This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.\n\n    Vector3  linear\n            float64 x\n            float64 y\n            float64 z\n    Vector3  angular\n            float64 x\n            float64 y\n            float64 z\n</code></pre> <p>This tells you that the /turtlesim node is expecting a message with two vectors, linear and angular, of three elements each. If you recall the data we saw /teleop_turtle passing to /turtlesim with the echo command, it\u2019s in the same structure:</p> <pre><code>linear:\n  x: 2.0\n  y: 0.0\n  z: 0.0\nangular:\n  x: 0.0\n  y: 0.0\n  z: 0.0\n  ---\n</code></pre> <p>7 ros2 topic pub</p> <p>Now that you have the message structure, you can publish data to a topic directly from the command line using:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic pub &lt;topic_name&gt; &lt;msg_type&gt; '&lt;args&gt;'\n</code></pre> The '' argument is the actual data you\u2019ll pass to the topic, in the structure you just discovered in the previous section. <p>It\u2019s important to note that this argument needs to be input in YAML syntax. Input the full command like so:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic pub --once /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \"{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}\"\n</code></pre> --once is an optional argument meaning \u201cpublish one message then exit\u201d.</p> <p>You will see the following output in the terminal:</p> <p><pre><code>publisher: beginning loop\npublishing #1: geometry_msgs.msg.Twist(linear=geometry_msgs.msg.Vector3(x=2.0, y=0.0, z=0.0), angular=geometry_msgs.msg.Vector3(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=1.8))\n</code></pre> And you will see the turtle moves a quarter turn to the left.</p> <p>The turtle (and commonly the real robots which it is meant to emulate) require a steady stream of commands to operate continuously. So, to get the turtle to keep moving, you can run:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic pub --rate 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \"{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}\"\n</code></pre> The difference here is the removal of the --once option and the addition of the --rate 1 option, which tells ros2 topic pub to publish the command in a steady stream at 1 Hz.</p> <p>You can refresh rqt_graph to see what\u2019s happening graphically. You will see that the ros2 topic pub ... node (/_ros2cli_30358) is publishing over the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, which is being received by both the ros2 topic echo ... node (/_ros2cli_26646) and the /turtlesim node now.</p> <p>Finally, you can run echo on the pose topic and recheck rqt_graph:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose\n</code></pre> You can see that the /turtlesim node is also publishing to the pose topic, which the new echo node has subscribed to.</p> <p>When publishing messages with timestamps, pub has two methods to automatically fill them out with the current time. For messages with a std_msgs/msg/Header, the header field can be set to auto to fill out the stamp field.</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic pub /pose geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped '{header: \"auto\", pose: {position: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}}}'\n</code></pre> If the message does not use a full header, but just has a field with type builtin_interfaces/msg/Time, that can be set to the value now.</p> <pre><code>ros2 topic pub /reference sensor_msgs/msg/TimeReference '{header: \"auto\", time_ref: \"now\", source: \"dumy\"}'\n</code></pre> <p>8 ros2 topic hz</p> <p>For one last introspection on this process, you can view the rate at which data is published using:</p> <p><pre><code>ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose\n</code></pre> It will return data on the rate at which the /turtlesim node is publishing data to the pose topic.</p> <p><pre><code>average rate: 59.354\n  min: 0.005s max: 0.027s std dev: 0.00284s window: 58\n</code></pre> Recall that you set the rate of turtle1/cmd_vel to publish at a steady 1 Hz using ros2 topic pub --rate 1. If you run the above command with turtle1/cmd_vel instead of turtle1/pose, you will see an average reflecting that rate.</p> <p>9 Clean up</p> <p>At this point you\u2019ll have a lot of nodes running.

It consists of an input layer, a linear transformation layer, and an output layer. The linear transformation layer is usually called a fully connected layer, where each input node is connected to each output node with a weighted connection.</p> <p>In a linear neural network, each input feature is multiplied by a weight, then all results are summed and a bias is added. Finally, the result is processed by an activation function to generate the final output.

As a class of machine learning, representational learning focuses on how to automatically find the appropriate way to represent data. Considered as multi-level representation learning through learning many layers of transformations, deep learning replaces not only the shallow models at the end of traditional machine learning pipelines, but also the labor-intensive process of feature engineering. Much of the recent progress in deep learning has been triggered by an abundance of data arising from cheap sensors and Internet-scale applications, and by significant progress in computation, mostly through GPUs.

In supervised learning, we want to predict something unknown (the target) given something known (the features). Depending on our objective, we might attempt to predict the most likely value of the target. Or we might predict the value with the smallest expected distance from the target. And sometimes we wish not only to predict a specific value but to quantify our uncertainty. For example, given some features describing a patient, we might want to know how likely they are to suffer a heart attack in the next year. In unsupervised learning, we often care about uncertainty. To determine whether a set of measurements are anomalous, it helps to know how likely one is to observe values in a population of interest. Furthermore, in reinforcement learning, we wish to develop agents that act intelligently in various environments. This requires reasoning about how an environment might be expected to change and what rewards one might expect to encounter in response to each of the available actions.</p> <p>Probability is the mathematical field concerned with reasoning under uncertainty. Given a probabilistic model of some process, we can reason about the likelihood of various events. The use of probabilities to describe the frequencies of repeatable events (like coin tosses) is fairly uncontroversial. In fact, frequentist scholars adhere to an interpretation of probability that applies only to such repeatable events. By contrast Bayesian scholars use the language of probability more broadly to formalize reasoning under uncertainty. Bayesian probability is characterized by two unique features: (i) assigning degrees of belief to non-repeatable events, e.g., what is the probability that a dam will collapse?; and (ii) subjectivity. While Bayesian probability provides unambiguous rules for how one should update their beliefs in light of new evidence, it allows for different individuals to start off with different prior beliefs. Statistics helps us to reason backwards, starting off with collection and organization of data and backing out to what inferences we might draw about the process that generated the data. Whenever we analyze a dataset, hunting for patterns that we hope might characterize a broader population, we are employing statistical thinking. Many courses, majors, theses, careers, departments, companies, and institutions have been devoted to the study of probability and statistics.

Moreover, for many tasks, those hard-to-optimize models turn out to be so much better that figuring out how to train them ends up being well worth the trouble.</p> <p>The key technique for optimizing nearly every deep learning model, and which we will call upon throughout this book, consists of iteratively reducing the error by updating the parameters in the direction that incrementally lowers the loss function. This algorithm is called gradient descent. </p> <p>The most naive application of gradient descent consists of taking the derivative of the loss function, which is an average of the losses computed on every single example in the dataset. In practice, this can be extremely slow: we must pass over the entire dataset before making a single update, even if the update steps might be very powerful. Even worse, if there is a lot of redundancy in the training data, the benefit of a full update is limited.</p> <p>The other extreme is to consider only a single example at a time and to take update steps based on one observation at a time. The resulting algorithm, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be an effective strategy, even for large datasets. Unfortunately, SGD has drawbacks, both computational and statistical. One problem arises from the fact that processors are a lot faster multiplying and adding numbers than they are at moving data from main memory to processor cache. It is up to an order of magnitude more efficient to perform a matrix\u2013vector multiplication than a corresponding number of vector\u2013vector operations. This means that it can take a lot longer to process one sample at a time compared to a full batch. A second problem is that some of the layers, such as batch normalization, only work well when we have access to more than one observation at a time.</p> <p>The solution to both problems is to pick an intermediate strategy: rather than taking a full batch or only a single sample at a time, we take a minibatch of observations (Li et al., 2014). The specific choice of the size of the said minibatch depends on many factors, such as the amount of memory, the number of accelerators, the choice of layers, and the total dataset size. Despite all that, a number between 32 and 256, preferably a multiple of a large power of 2, is a good start. This leads us to minibatch stochastic gradient descent.</p> <p>In its most basic form, in each iteration \\(t\\) we first randomly sample a minibatch \\(\\mathcal{B}^{(t)}\\) consisting of a fixed number of training examples. We then compute the derivative (gradient) of the average loss on the minibatch (averaging loss over the minibatch examples) with regard to the model parameters. Finally, we multiply the gradient by a predetermined positive value \\(\\eta\\) and subtract the resulting term from the current parameter values. Next, we iterate over the dataset again and again until we find an answer that is good enough (or until we run out of time).</p> \\[\\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{w}^{(t)} - \\eta \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}^{(t)}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}^{(t)}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathcal{L}^{(i)} (\\mathbf{w}^{(t)})\\] <p>In summary, minibatch SGD proceeds as follows: (i) initialize the values of the model parameters, typically at random; (ii) iteratively sample random minibatches from the data, updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. For quadratic losses and affine transformations, this has a closed-form expansion:</p> \\[\\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} \\leftarrow (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\\] <p>Frequently minibatch size and learning rate are user-defined. Such tunable parameters that are not updated in the training loop are called hyperparameters. They can be tuned automatically by a number of techniques, such as Bayesian optimization.

An example of an IPv4 address is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and an example of an IPv6 address is xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx. However, it is difficult for people to remember these numbers, so domain names are used to identify websites instead. A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website.

It introduces the basic concepts and techniques of C++ in detail and in detail through a large number of short and concise programs and devotes a chapter to the new features added by C++11.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Chapter 1: Getting Started with C++ - Chapter 1 relates how Bjarne Stroustrup created the C++ programming language by adding object-oriented programming support to the C language. You\u2019ll learn the distinctions between procedural languages, such as C, and object-oriented languages, such as C++.You\u2019ll read about the joint ANSI/ISO work to develop a C++ standard. This chapter discusses the mechanics of creating a C++ program, outlining the approach for several current C++ compilers. Finally, it describes the conventions used in this book.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 2: Setting Out to C++ \u2014 Chapter 2 guides you through the process of creating simple C++ programs. You\u2019ll learn about the role of the main() function and about some of the kinds of statements that C++ programs use. You\u2019ll use the predefined cout and cin objects for program output and input, and you\u2019ll learn about creating and using variables. Finally, you\u2019ll be introduced to functions, C++\u2019s programming modules.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 3: Dealing with Data \u2014 C++ provides built-in types for storing two kinds of data: integers (numbers with no fractional parts) and floating-point numbers (numbers with fractional parts). To meet the diverse requirements of programmers, C++ offers several types in each category. Chapter 3 discusses those types, including creating variables and writing constants of various types. You\u2019 ll also learn how C++ handles implicit and explicit conversions from one type to another. </p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 4: Compound Types \u2014 C++ lets you construct more elaborate types from the basic built-in types. The most advanced form is the class, discussed in Chapters 9 through 13. Chapter 4 discusses other forms, including arrays, which hold several values of a single type; structures, which hold several values of unlike types; and pointers, which identify locations in memory. You\u2019ll also learn how to create and store text strings and to handle text I/O by using C-style character arrays and the C++ string class. Finally, you\u2019ll learn some of the ways C++ handles memory allocation, including using the new and delete operators for managing memory explicitly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 5: Loops and Relational Expressions \u2014 Programs often must perform repetitive actions, and C++ provides three looping structures for that purpose: the for loop, the while loop, and the do while loop. Such loops must know when they should terminate, and the C++ relational operators enable you to create tests to guide such loops. In Chapter 5 you learn how to create loops that read and process input character-by-character. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to create two-dimensional arrays and how to use nested loops to process them. </p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 6: Branching Statements and Logical Operators \u2014 Programs can behave intelligently if they can tailor their behavior to circumstances. In Chapter 6 you\u2019ll learn how to control program flow by using the if, if else, and switch statements and the conditional operator. You\u2019ll learn how to use logical operators to help express decision-making tests. Also, you\u2019ll meet the cctype library of functions for evaluating character relations, such as testing whether a character is a digit or a nonprinting character. Finally, you\u2019ll get an introductory view of file I/O.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 7: Functions: C++\u2019s Programming Modules \u2014 Functions are the basic building blocks of C++ programming. Chapter 7 concentrates on features that C++ functions share with C functions. In particular, you\u2019ll review the general for-mat of a function definition and examine how function prototypes increase the reliability of programs. Also, you\u2019ll investigate how to write functions to process arrays, character strings, and structures. Next, you\u2019ll learn about recursion, which is when a function calls itself and see how it can be used to implement a divide-and-conquer strategy. Finally, you\u2019ll meet pointers to functions, which enable you to use a function argument to tell one function to use a second function.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 8: Adventures in Functions \u2014 Chapter 8 explores the new features C++ adds to functions. You\u2019ll learn about inline functions, which can speed program execution at the cost of additional program size. You\u2019ll work with reference variables, which provide an alternative way to pass information to functions. Default arguments let a function automatically supply values for function arguments that you omit from a function call. Function overloading lets you create functions having the same name but taking different argument lists. All these features have frequent use in class design. Also you\u2019ll learn about function templates, which allow you to specify the design of a family of related functions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 9: Memory Models and Namespaces \u2014 Chapter 9 discusses putting together multifile programs. It examines the choices in allocating memory, looking at different methods of managing memory and at scope, linkage, and namespaces, which determine what parts of a program know about a variable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 10: Objects and Classes \u2014 A class is a user-defined type, and an object (such as a variable) is an instance of a class. Chapter 10 introduces you to object-oriented programming and to class design. A class declaration describes the information stored in a class object and also the operations (class methods) allowed for class objects. Some parts of an object are visible to the outside world (the public portion), and some are hidden (the private portion). Special class methods (constructors and destructors) come into play when objects are created and destroyed. You will learn about all this and other class details in this chapter, and you\u2019ll see how classes can be used to implement ADTs, such as a stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 11: Working with Classes \u2014 I \u2014 Chapter 11 you\u2019ll further your under-standing of classes. First, you\u2019ll learn about operator overloading, which lets you define how operators such as + will work with class objects. You\u2019ll learn about friend functions, which can access class data that\u2019s inaccessible to the world at large. You\u2019ll see how certain constructors and overloaded operator member functions can be used to manage conversion to and from class types. </p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 12: Classes and Dynamic Memory Allocation \u2014 Often it\u2019s useful to have a class member point to dynamically allocated memory. If you use new in a class constructor to allocate dynamic memory, you incur the responsibilities of providing an appropriate destructor, of defining an explicit copy constructor, and of defining an explicit assignment operator. Chapter 12 shows you how and discusses the behavior of the member functions generated implicitly if you fail to provide explicit definitions. You\u2019ll also expand your experience with classes by using pointers to objects and studying a queue simulation problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 13: Class Inheritance \u2014 One of the most powerful features of object-oriented programming is inheritance, by which a derived class inherits the features of a base class, enabling you to reuse the base class code. Chapter 13 discusses public inheritance, which models <code>is-a</code> relationship, meaning that a derived object is a special case of a base object. For example, a physicist is a special case of a scientist. Some inheritance relationships are polymorphic, meaning you can write code using a mixture of related classes for which the same method name may invoke behavior that depends on the object type. Implementing this kind of behavior necessitates using a new kind of member function called a virtual function. Sometimes using abstract base classes is the best approach to inheritance relationships. This chapter discusses these matters, pointing out when public inheritance is appropriate and when it is not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 14: Reusing Code in C++ \u2014 Public inheritance is just one way to reuse code. Chapter 14 looks at several other ways. Containment is when one class contains members that are objects of another class. It can be used to model has a relationship, in which one class has components of another class. For example, an automobile has a motor. You also can use private and protected inheritance to model such relationships. This chapter shows you how and points out the differences among the different approaches. Also, you\u2019ll learn about class templates, which let you define a class in terms of some unspecified generic type, and then use the template to create specific classes in terms of specific types. For example, a stack template enables you to create a stack of integers or a stack of strings. Finally, you\u2019ll learn about multiple public inheritance, whereby a class can derive from more than one class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 15: Friends, Exceptions, and More \u2014 Chapter 15 extends the discussion of friends to include friend classes and friend member functions. Then it presents several new developments in C++, beginning with exceptions, which provide a mechanism for dealing with unusual program occurrences, such an inappropriate function argument values and running out of memory. Then you\u2019ll learn about RTTI, a mechanism for identifying object types. Finally, you\u2019ll learn about the safer alternatives to unrestricted typecasting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 16: The string Class and the Standard Template Library \u2014 Chapter 16 discusses some useful class libraries recently added to the language. The string class is a convenient and powerful alternative to traditional C-style strings. The auto_ptr class helps manage dynamically allocated memory. The STL provides several generic containers, including template representations of arrays, queues, lists, sets, and maps. It also provides an efficient library of generic algorithms that can be used with STL containers and also with ordinary arrays. The valarray template class provides sup-port for numeric arrays.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 17: Input, Output, and Files \u2014 Chapter 17 reviews C++ I/O and dis-cusses how to format output. You\u2019ll learn how to use class methods to determine the state of an input or output stream and to see, for example, whether there has been a type mismatch on input or whether the end-of-file has been detected. C++ uses inheritance to derive classes for managing file input and output. You\u2019ll learn how to open files for input and output, how to append data to a file, how to use binary files, and how to get random access to a file. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to apply standard I/O methods to read from and write to strings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapter 18: Visiting with the New C++ Standard \u2014 Chapter 18 begins by reviewing several C++11 features introduced in earlier chapters, including new types, uniform initialization syntax, automatic type deduction, new smart pointers, and scoped enumerations. The chapter then discusses the new rvalue reference type and how it\u2019s used to implement a new feature called move semantics. Next, the chapter covers new class features, lambda expressions, and variadic templates. Finally, the chapter outlines many new features not covered in earlier chapters of the book.</p> </li> <li> <p>Appendix A: Number Bases\u2014Appendix A discusses octal, hexadecimal, and binary numbers.</p> </li> <li>Appendix B: C++ Reserved Words\u2014Appendix B lists C++ keywords.</li> <li>Appendix C: The ASCII Character Set\u2014Appendix C lists the ASCII character set, along with decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.</li> <li>Appendix D: Operator Precedence\u2014Appendix D lists the C++ operators in order of decreasing precedence.</li> <li>Appendix E: Other Operators\u2014Appendix E summarizes the C++ operators, such as the bitwise operators, not covered in the main body of the text.</li> <li>Appendix F: The string Template Class\u2014Appendix F summarizes string class methods and functions.</li> <li>Appendix G: The Standard Template Library Methods and Functions\u2014 Appendix G summarizes the STL container methods and the general STL  algorithm functions.</li> <li>Appendix H: Selected Readings and Internet Resources\u2014Appendix H lists some books that can further your understanding of C++.</li> <li>Appendix I: Converting to ISO Standard C++\u2014Appendix I provides guidelines for moving from C and older C++ implementations to ANSI/ISO C++.</li> <li>Appendix J: Answers to Chapter Review\u2014Appendix J contains the answers to the review questions posed at the end of each chapter.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/","title":"CH01 Getting Started with C++","text":"<p>C++ = C + Classes + Templates</p> <ul> <li>Its C ancestry brings to C++ the tradition of an efficient, compact, fast,and portable language.</li> <li>Its object-oriented heritage brings C++ a fresh programming methodology, designed to cope with the escalating complexity of modern programming tasks. </li> <li>Its template features bring yet another new programming methodology: generic programming.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#11-learning-c-what-lies-before-you","title":"1.1 Learning C++: What Lies Before You","text":"<p>C++ joins three separate programming categories:  - the procedural language, represented by C; - the object-oriented language, represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C; - the generic programming, supported by C++ templates.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#12-the-origins-of-c-a-little-history","title":"1.2 The Origins of C++: A Little History","text":""},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#121-the-c-language","title":"1.2.1 The C Language","text":"<p>~</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#122-c-programming-philosophy","title":"1.2.2 C Programming Philosophy","text":"<ul> <li>Procedural Programming - Emphasizes Algorithms</li> <li>Structured Programming</li> <li>Top-Down Programming</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#123-the-c-shift-object-oriented-programming","title":"1.2.3 The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming","text":"<ul> <li>Object-Oriented Programming - Emphasizes Data</li> <li>Bottom-Up Programming</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#124-c-and-generic-programming","title":"1.2.4 C++ and Generic Programming","text":"<ul> <li>Generic Programming - Emphasizes Code Reuse, Independent of Specific Data Types</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#125-the-genesis-of-c","title":"1.2.5 The Genesis of C++","text":"<p>OOP provides high-level abstractions, C provides low-level hardware access.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#13-portability-and-standards","title":"1.3 Portability and Standards","text":"<p>Portability: Write Once, Run Anywhere.</p> <p>Two barriers to portability: - Machine Dependencies - Language Dependencies</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#131-language-growth","title":"1.3.1 Language Growth","text":"<p>~</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#132-this-book-and-c-standards","title":"1.3.2 This Book and C++ Standards","text":"<p>~</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#14-the-mechanics-of-creating-a-program","title":"1.4 The Mechanics of Creating a Program","text":"<p>Programs are created in three steps: - Create the source code file. - Compile the source code file. - Link the compiled file.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#141-creating-the-source-code-file","title":"1.4.1 Creating the Source Code File","text":"<p>IDE~</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH01/ch01/#142-compilation-and-linking","title":"1.4.2 Compilation and Linking","text":"<p>Tip</p> <p>When correcting errors, correct the first error first.

In response to these conditions, computer languages have evolved so that it\u2019s easier to manage the programming process.The C language incorporated features such as control structures and functions to better control the flow of a program and to enable a more structured, modular approach.To these tools C++ adds support for object-oriented programming and generic programming.This enables even more modularity and facilitates the creation of reusable code, which saves time and increases program reliability. The popularity of C++ has resulted in a large number of implementations for many computing platforms; the C++ ISO standards (C++98/03 and C++11) provide a basis for keeping these many implementations mutually compatible.The standards establishes the features the language should have, the behavior the language should display,and a standard library of functions, classes,and templates.The standards supports the goal of a portable language across different computing platforms and different implementations of the language. To create a C++ program, you create one or more source files containing the program as expressed in the C++ language.These are text files that must be compiled and linked to produce the machine-language files that constitute executable programs.These tasks are often accomplished in an IDE that provides a text editor for creating the source files,a  compiler and a linker for producing executable files,and other resources, such as project management and debugging capabilities. But the same tasks can also be performed in a command-line environment by invoking the appropriate tools individually</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH02/ch02/","title":"Setting Out to C++","text":"<p>When you construct a simple home, you begin with the foundation and the framework.

To understand your source code, a compiler needs to know when one statement ends and another begins. Some languages use a statement separator.

In Pascal you can omit the semicolon in certain cases, such as after a statement just before an END, when you aren\u2019t actually separating two statements. (Pragmatists and minimalists will disagree about whether can implies should.) But C++, like C, uses a semicolon as a terminator rather than as a separator. The difference is that a semicolon acting as a terminator is part of the statement rather than a marker between statements.

The function header tells you what kind of return value, if any, the function produces and what sort of information it expects arguments to pass to it.The function body consists of a series of C++ statements enclosed in paired braces ({}). C++ statement types include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Declaration statement\u2014A declaration statement announces the name and the type of a variable used in a function.</li> <li>Assignment statement\u2014An assignment statement uses the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.</li> <li>Message statement\u2014A message statement sends a message to an object, initiating some sort of action.</li> <li>Function call\u2014A function call activates a function.When the called function terminates, the program returns to the statement in the calling function immediately following the function call.</li> <li>Function prototype\u2014A function prototype declares the return type for a function, along with the number and type of arguments the function expects.</li> <li>Return statement\u2014A return statement sends a value from a called function back to the calling function.</li> </ul> <p>A class is a user-defined specification for a data type.This specification details how information is to be represented and also the operations that can be performed with the data.An object is an entity created according to a class prescription, just as a simple variable is an entity created according to a data type description. C++ provides two predefined objects (cin and cout) for handling input and output. They are examples of the istream and ostream classes, which are defined in the iostream file.These classes view input and output as streams of characters.The insertion operator (&lt;&lt;), which is defined for the ostream class, lets you insert data into the output stream,and the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;), which is defined for the istream class, lets you extract information from the input stream. Both cin and cout are smart objects, capable of automatically converting information from one form to another according to the program context.

But how does the compiler determine the type of constants? The answer is, unless there is a reason to store them as another type (such as using special suffixes to represent specific types, or the value being too large to be stored as an int), C++ stores integral constants as <code>int</code> type by default.</p> <p>First, let's examine suffixes. Suffixes are letters placed after numeric constants to indicate their type. The suffixes 1 or L after an integer denote it as a long constant, u or U suffix denotes an unsigned int constant, and ul (in any order, uppercase or lowercase) denotes an unsigned long constant (since lowercase \"l\" looks like \"1\", uppercase \"L\" is preferred as a suffix). For example, on a system where int is 16 bits and long is 32 bits, the number 22022 is stored as an int, taking up 16 bits, while 22022L is stored as a long, occupying 32 bits. Similarly, 22022LU and 22022UL are both stored as unsigned long. C++11 provides suffixes 11 and LL for representing the type long long, as well as suffixes ull, UII, uLL, and ULL for representing the type unsigned long long.</p> <p>Next, let's consider length. In C++, the rules for decimal integers differ slightly from hexadecimal and octal. For decimal integers without suffixes, the smallest type capable of storing the number will be used: int, long, or long long. On a computer system where int is 16 bits and long is 32 bits, 20000 is represented as an int, 40000 as a long, and 3000000000 as a long long. For hexadecimal or octal integers without suffixes, the smallest type capable of storing the number will be used: int, unsigned int, long, long long, or unsigned long long. In a computer system where 40000 is represented as a long, the hexadecimal number 0x9C40 (40000) will be represented as unsigned int. This is because hexadecimal is commonly used to represent memory addresses, which are unsigned, making unsigned int more suitable for representing 16-bit addresses than long.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH03/ch03/#the-char-type-characters-and-small-integers","title":"The char Type: Characters and Small Integers","text":"<p>Here, we introduce the last type of integer: the char type.

Floating-point numbers can represent numbers with a fractional part, such as the gas mileage of a car (0.56 MPG), and they offer a larger range of values. If a number is too large to be represented as a long type, such as the number of bacteria in the human body (estimated to be over 100 trillion), floating-point types can be used to represent it.</p> <p>Floating-point types can represent numbers with fractional parts, such as 2.5, 3.14159, and 122442.32. Computers store such values in two parts. One part represents the value, and the other part is used to scale the value up or down. In other words, one part is for the value, and the other part is for the magnitude of the value. Let's illustrate this with an example. For the numbers 34-1245 and 34124.5, except for the position of the decimal point, they are essentially the same. The first number can be represented as -0.341245 (base value) and -100 (scale factor), while the second number can be represented as 0.341245 (same base value) and 10000 (larger scale factor). The scale factor is responsible for moving the decimal point, hence the term \"floating point.\" C++ internally represents floating-point numbers in a similar manner, but it's based on binary numbers, so the scale factor is powers of 2, not powers of 10. Fortunately, programmers don't need to understand the internal representation in detail. What's important is that floating-point numbers can represent decimal values, very large, and very small values, and their internal representation is vastly different from integers.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B-NOTES/CH03/ch03/#writing-floating-point-numbers","title":"Writing Floating-Point Numbers","text":"<p>C++ offers two ways to write floating-point numbers.</p> <p>The first method is to use the commonly used standard decimal notation: even if the fractional part is 0 (e.g., 8.0), the decimal point ensures that the number is represented in floating-point format (rather than integer format).</p> <p>The second method for representing floating-point values is called E-notation, which is most suitable for very large and very small numbers.

Generally, automatic conversion refers to converting \"narrower\" operands to \"wider\" operands without losing information. Meaningless expressions are not allowed, for example, using a float expression as an index is not allowed. The compiler may give warning messages for expressions that may result in information loss, such as assigning a longer integer value to a shorter integer variable, assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable, and so on, but these expressions are not illegal.</p> <p>Since the char type is a smaller integer type, char variables can be freely used in arithmetic expressions, which provides great flexibility for certain character conversions. For example, the following function atoi converts a string of digits into the corresponding numeric value.</p> <p>When converting a character type to an integer type, we need to be careful. C language does not specify whether a char variable is unsigned or signed. When converting a char value to an int value, is it possible for the result to be a negative integer? The result varies for different machines, reflecting the differences between different machine architectures. In some machines, if the leftmost bit of the char value is 1, it is converted to a negative integer (performing \"sign extension\"). In other machines, when converting a char value to an int value, a 0 is added to the left of the char value, resulting in a positive value.</p> <p>The C language definition guarantees that characters in the standard printing character set of the machine will not be negative values, so these characters are always positive in expressions. However, the bit pattern stored in a character variable can be negative on some machines and positive on others. To ensure program portability, it is best to specify the signed or unsigned qualifier if non-character data is stored in a char variable.</p> <p>In C language, implicit arithmetic type conversion occurs in many cases. Generally, if the two operands of a binary operator (an operator with two operands, such as + or *) have different types, the \"lower\" type is promoted to the \"higher\" type before the operation, and the result of the operation is of the higher type.</p> <p>Type conversion also occurs during assignment. The value on the right side of the assignment operator needs to be converted to the type of the variable on the left side, which is the type of the result of the assignment expression.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, whether or not sign extension is performed, character variables will be converted to integer variables. When converting a longer integer to a shorter integer or char type, the exceeding high-order bits will be discarded.</p> <p>In any expression, you can use a unary operator called a cast operator to perform explicit type conversion.

Directly entering the next branch without a <code>break</code> statement is not a sound practice and can lead to errors during program modification.

The adjectives \"external\" and \"internal\" are used in contrast, with \"internal\" describing function parameters and variables defined within a function. External variables are defined outside functions, allowing them to be used in multiple functions. Since C does not permit the definition of other functions within a function, functions themselves are considered \"external.\" By default, external variables and functions share the property that all references to an external variable by the same name (even if these references come from different functions compiled separately) actually refer to the same object (referred to as external linkage in the standard).</p> <p>Because external variables can be accessed globally, they provide an alternative way for data exchange between functions instead of using function parameters and return values. Any function can access an external variable by name, which needs to be declared in some way.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>External variables can increase coupling between programs, so their usage should be minimized.</p> <p>The utility of external variables is also evident in their larger scope and longer lifespan compared to internal variables. Automatic variables can only be used within a function, existing from the moment the function is called until it exits. In contrast, external variables persist permanently, and their values remain unchanged from one function call to the next. Therefore, if two functions need to share certain data and do not call each other, the most convenient approach is to define these shared data as external variables rather than passing them as function parameters.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation (operators are written after their operands). RPN does not require parentheses; it only needs to know how many operands each operator requires to avoid ambiguity.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Calculator Implementation: The implementation of a calculator program is straightforward. Each operand is sequentially pushed onto the stack. When an operator is encountered, the corresponding number of operands (two operands for binary operators) are popped from the stack, the operator is applied to the popped operands, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.</p> <p><pre><code>while (next operator or operand is not the end-of-file indicator)\n{\n    if (it is a number)\n    {\n        push the number onto the stack;\n    }\n    else if (it is an operator)\n    {\n        pop the required number of operands;\n        perform the operation;\n        push the result onto the stack;\n    }\n    else if (it is a newline character)\n    {\n        pop and print the value at the top of the stack;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle error\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> The push and pop operations for the stack are relatively simple, but if error detection and recovery operations are included, the program can become lengthy. It is advisable to design independent functions for error handling and recovery, rather than using them as repetitive code segments in the program. Additionally, a separate function is needed to fetch the next input operator or operand.</p> <p>So far, we haven't discussed a crucial aspect of the design: where to place the stack? In other words, which routines can directly access it? One possibility is to place it in the main function, passing the stack and its current position as parameters to functions that perform push or pop operations on it. However, the main function doesn't need to be aware of the stack's variable details; it only performs push and pop operations. Therefore, the stack and related information can be stored in external variables, accessible only to the push and pop functions, not to the main function.</p> <p>Translating the above paragraph into code is straightforward. If the program is in a single source file, it might look something like the following:</p> <p><pre><code>```c\n#include &lt;...&gt;   // Some included header files\n#define ...      // Some define definitions\n\n// Function declarations used by main\nmain() {\n    // ...\n\n    void push(double f);\n    double pop(void);\n    int getop(char s[]);\n\n    // ...\n}\n\n// External variables used by push and pop\nvoid push(double f) {\n    // ...\n}\n\ndouble pop(void) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Function called by getop\nint someFunction(void) {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre> In the later sections, we will discuss how to split this program into two or more source files.</p> <p>The <code>main</code> function includes a large <code>switch</code> loop, which controls the program flow based on the type of operator or operand. The usage of the <code>switch</code> statement here is more typical than the example in Section 3.4. <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* for atof() */\n#define MAXOP 100   /* max size of operand or operator */\n#define NUMBER '0'  /* signal that a number was found */\nint getop(char[]);\nvoid push(double);\ndouble pop(void);\n/* reverse Polish calculator */\nmain()\n{\n    int type;\n    double op2;\n    char s[MAXOP];\n    while ((type = getop(s)) != EOF)\n    {\n        switch (type)\n        {\n        case NUMBER:\n            push(atof(s));\n            break;\n        case '+':\n            push(pop() + pop());\n            break;\n        case '*':\n            push(pop() * pop());\n            break;\n        case '-':\n            op2 = pop();\n            push(pop() - op2);\n            break;\n        case '/':\n            op2 = pop();\n            if (op2 != 0.0)\n                push(pop() / op2);\n            else\n                printf(\"error: zero divisor\\n\");\n            break;\n        case '\\n':\n            printf(\"\\t%.8g\\n\", pop());\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\"error: unknown command %s\\n\", s);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> Because the <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> operators satisfy the commutative property, the order of popping operands is not crucial. However, for the <code>-</code> and <code>/</code> operators, the left and right operands must be distinguished. The order of evaluation for the two <code>pop</code> calls is not defined in a function call. To ensure the correct order, the first value must be popped into a temporary variable, similar to what is done in the <code>main</code> function.</p> <p><pre><code>push(pop() - pop()); /* WRONG */\n</code></pre> <pre><code>#define MAXVAL 100  /* maximum depth of val stack */\nint sp = 0;         /* next free stack position */\ndouble val[MAXVAL]; /* value stack */\n/* push: push f onto value stack */\nvoid push(double f)\n{\n    if (sp &lt; MAXVAL)\n        val[sp++] = f;\n    else\n        printf(\"error: stack full, can't push %g\\n\", f);\n}\n/* pop: pop and return top value from stack */\ndouble pop(void)\n{\n    if (sp &gt; 0)\n        return val[--sp];\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"error: stack empty\\n\");\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> If a variable is defined outside of any function, it is an external variable. Therefore, we define the stack and stack pointer, which must be shared by the <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> functions, externally.</p> <p>Now, let's take a look at the implementation of the <code>getop</code> function. This function retrieves the next operator or operand. The task is relatively straightforward. It needs to skip spaces and tabs. If the next character is not a digit or a decimal point, it returns; otherwise, it collects the string of digits (which may include a decimal point) and returns <code>NUMBER</code> to indicate that a number has been collected.</p> <p><pre><code>#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\nint getch(void);\nvoid ungetch(int);\n/* getop: get next character or numeric operand */\nint getop(char s[])\n{\n    int i, c;\n    while ((s[0] = c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\\t')\n        ;\n    s[1] = '\\0';\n    if (!isdigit(c) &amp;&amp; c != '.')\n        return c; /* not a number */\n    i = 0;\n    if (isdigit(c)) /* collect integer part */\n        while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))\n            ;\n    if (c == '.') /* collect fraction part */\n        while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))\n            ;\n    s[i] = '\\0';\n    if (c != EOF)\n        ungetch(c);\n    return NUMBER;\n}\n</code></pre> The <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> functions in this program serve a specific purpose. Often in programs, there is a situation where the program cannot determine if it has read enough input unless it reads a bit more ahead. One example is when reading characters to compose a number: before encountering the first non-digit character, the completeness of the read number cannot be guaranteed. Since the program needs to read one extra character ahead, it leads to having one character that doesn't belong to the current number being read.</p> <p>This problem can be addressed by \"unreading\" the unnecessary characters. Whenever a program reads an extra character, it can push it back into the input stream, making it as if the character was not read for the rest of the code. We can write a pair of collaborating functions to conveniently simulate this \"ungetting\" operation. The <code>getch</code> function is used to read the next character to be processed, while the <code>ungetch</code> function is used to put a character back into the input stream. Subsequently, when calling the <code>getch</code> function, it returns the character put back by the <code>ungetch</code> function before reading new input.</p> <pre><code>#define BUFSIZE 100\nchar buf[BUFSIZE]; /* buffer for ungetch */\nint bufp = 0;      /* next free position in buf */\nint getch(void)    /* get a (possibly pushed-back) character */\n{\n    return (bufp &gt; 0) ? buf[--bufp] : getchar();\n}\nvoid ungetch(int c) /* push character back on input */\n{\n    if (bufp &gt;= BUFSIZE)\n        printf(\"ungetch: too many characters\\n\");\n    else\n        buf[bufp++] = c;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C-NOTES/c-notes/#44-scope-rules","title":"4.4 Scope Rules","text":"<p>Functions and external variables that constitute a C language program can be compiled separately.

We try to concentrate shared portions as much as possible so that only one copy is needed, making it easier to ensure correctness when improving the program.</p> <p></p> <p>We make a compromise between two factors: on one hand, we want each file to access only the information it needs to complete its task; on the other hand, maintaining many header files in reality can be challenging. A conclusion we can draw is that for medium-sized programs, it's best to use a single header file to store objects shared among different parts of the program. Larger programs may require more header files, and careful organization is needed.</p> <p>For certain variables, such as the variables <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> defined in the file <code>stack.c</code>, and the variables <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code> defined in the file <code>getch.c</code>, they are intended for use only by functions within their respective source files, and other functions should not have access to them. Using the <code>static</code> declaration to qualify external variables and functions can restrict the scope of objects declared later to the remaining part of the compiled source file. By using <code>static</code> to qualify external objects, the goal of hiding external objects can be achieved, for example, the composite structure of <code>getch-ungetch</code> needs to share the variables <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code>. Thus, <code>buf</code> and <code>bufp</code> must be external variables, but these two objects should not be accessible to callers of the <code>getch</code> and <code>ungetch</code> functions.</p> <p>To designate an object as having static storage duration, you can add the <code>static</code> keyword as a prefix before the regular object declaration.

Therefore, these two names will not conflict with the same names in other files within the same program. Similarly, the variables <code>sp</code> and <code>val</code> can be declared as static to hide these variables used by the <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> functions, which manipulate the execution stack.</p> <p>External static declarations are commonly used for variables, and they can also be used for function declarations. Generally, function names are globally accessible and visible to all parts of the program.

By definition, the value of a variable or expression of an array type is the address of the 0<sup>th</sup> element of that array. The array name represents the address of the first element of the array. Therefore, if <code>pa</code> is a pointer to an array <code>a</code>, the statements <code>pa = &amp;a[0];</code> and <code>pa = a;</code> are equivalent.

The format parameter will be discussed in the following content. All other parameters must be pointers, specifying the locations where the converted input will be saved.</p> <p>When the <code>scanf</code> function scans the entire format string or encounters a situation where some input cannot match the format control specification, the function terminates. The number of successfully matched and assigned input items is returned as the function value. Therefore, the return value of the function can be used to determine the number of matched input items. If the end of the file is reached, the function will return EOF. Note that returning EOF is different from 0; 0 indicates that the next input character does not match the first format specification in the format string.</p> <p>There is also an input function <code>sscanf</code>, which is used to read character sequences from a string (not standard input).</p> <p>The format string usually contains conversion specifications, which control the input conversion. The format string may contain the following parts:</p> <ul> <li>Spaces or tabs that will be ignored during processing.</li> <li>Ordinary characters (excluding %), used to match the next non-whitespace character in the input stream.</li> <li>Conversion specifications, consisting of a %, an optional assignment suppression character *, an optional number (specifying the maximum field width), an optional h, l, or L character (specifying the width of the target object), and a conversion character.</li> </ul> <p>The conversion specification controls the interpretation of the next input field. In general, the conversion result is stored in the variable pointed to by the corresponding argument. However, if there is an assignment suppression character * in the conversion specification, the input field is skipped without assignment. The input field is defined as a string that does not include whitespace characters, and its boundary is defined as reaching the next whitespace character or reaching the specified field width. This implies that the <code>scanf</code> function will skip over line boundaries to read input because newline characters are also whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, newline characters, carriage return characters, vertical tabs, and form feed characters).</p> <p>The conversion character specifies the interpretation of the input field. The corresponding parameter must be a pointer, as required by the call-by-value semantics of the C language.</p> <p>Basic conversion specifications for the <code>scanf</code> function are as follows:</p> Conversion Meaning d Decimal integer i Decimal, octal, or hexadecimal integer o Octal integer u Unsigned decimal integer x Hexadecimal integer c Character s String e, f, g Floating-point number <p>Conversion specifications d, i, o, u, and x can be prefixed with the characters h or l. The prefix h indicates that the corresponding parameter in the argument list is a pointer to a short type, not an int type. The prefix l indicates that the corresponding parameter in the argument list is a pointer to a long type. Similarly, the prefixes l for e, f, and g indicate that the corresponding parameter in the argument list is a pointer to a double type, not a float type.</p> <p>The <code>scanf</code> function ignores spaces and tabs in the format string. Additionally, when reading input values, it skips whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newline characters, etc.). If you want to read input with an unpredictable format, it's best to read one line at a time and then use <code>sscanf</code> to separate the appropriate format for reading.</p> <p>Note that all parameters for <code>scanf</code> and <code>sscanf</code> functions must be pointers.</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C-NOTES/c-notes/#75-file-access","title":"7.5 File Access","text":"<p>So far, the examples we've discussed involve reading data from standard input and outputting data to standard output. Standard input and standard output are automatically provided by the operating system for program access.</p> <p>The <code>fopen</code> function returns a file pointer, which is a pointer to the <code>FILE</code> type object. The <code>FILE</code> type is a structure that contains the information needed for the program to access the file. The first parameter of the <code>fopen</code> function is a string containing the file name and access mode. The second parameter is a string specifying the access mode of the file. The <code>fopen</code> function returns a pointer to the <code>FILE</code> type object, and if the file opening fails, it returns a null pointer.</p> <p>The allowed access modes for <code>fopen</code> are as follows:</p> Mode Meaning r Open an existing text file for reading. w Open a text file for writing. If the file does not exist, create a new file. If the file already exists, clear its contents. a Open a text file for writing. If the file does not exist, create a new file.

If the file already exists, clear its contents. ab+ Open a binary file for reading and writing. If the file does not exist, create a new file. If the file already exists, append to the end of the file. <p>When a C program is launched, the operating system environment is responsible for opening three files and providing their pointers to the program. These three files are standard input, standard output, and standard error, with corresponding file pointers <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code> declared in <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>. In most environments, <code>stdin</code> points to the keyboard, while <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> point to the display. As discussed in Section 7.1, <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> can be redirected to files or pipes.</p> <p>For formatted input or output of files, you can use the <code>fscanf</code> and <code>fprintf</code> functions. The only difference between them and the <code>scanf</code> and <code>printf</code> functions is that their first parameter is a pointer to the file to be read or written, and the second parameter is the format string.</p> <p>The <code>fclose</code> function performs the opposite of <code>fopen</code>. It disconnects the connection between the file pointer established by <code>fopen</code> and the external name and releases the file pointer for use by other files. Because most operating systems restrict the number of files a program can open simultaneously, it is a good programming practice to release file pointers when they are no longer needed. There is another reason to execute <code>fclose</code> for an output file: it will write the output collected by the <code>putc</code> function in the buffer to the file. When the program terminates normally, the <code>fclose</code> function is automatically called for each open file. (If <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> are not needed, they can be closed. They can also be redirected using the <code>freopen</code> library function.)</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C-NOTES/c-notes/#76-error-handling-stderr-and-exit","title":"7.6 Error Handling - <code>stderr</code> and <code>exit</code>","text":"<p>\uff5e</p>"},{"location":"CODING/C-C%2B%2B/C-NOTES/c-notes/#77-line-input-and-line-output","title":"7.7 Line Input and Line Output","text":"<p>The <code>fgets</code> function reads the next input line (including the newline character) from the file pointed to by <code>fp</code> and stores it in the character array <code>line</code>.

The wavelet analysis method shown above is called Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).</p> <p>To reduce computational complexity and eliminate unnecessary repeated coefficients, the commonly used method in practice is Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).</p> <p>What does \"discrete\" mean in this context?</p> <p>Let's first go back to the expression of the wavelet base wave (also called the mother wavelet):</p> \\[ \\Psi_{s\\tau}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s}}\\Psi\\left(\\frac{t-\\tau}{s}\\right) \\] <p>Here, \\( s \\) is the scale parameter, representing frequency, and \\( t \\) is the shift parameter, representing time. As mentioned in the referenced link, in the continuous wavelet transform, \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) are continuous.</p> <p>In discrete wavelet transform, \"discrete\" refers to the parameters \\( s \\) and \\( t \\). The wavelet expression becomes:</p> \\[ \\Psi_{j,k}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s_0^j}}\\Psi\\left(\\frac{t-k\\tau_0s_0^j}{s_0^j}\\right) \\] <p>Here, \\( j \\) and \\( k \\) are integers, usually taking \\( s_0=2 \\) and \\( \\tau_0=1 \\).</p> <p>As \\( j \\) increases, we obtain a series of different wavelets (daughter wavelets). The scale parameters of these daughter wavelets grow exponentially by powers of 2. When using this series of daughter wavelets to discretely analyze a continuous function, we obtain a set of wavelet analysis coefficients. This analysis process is called wavelet series decomposition.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, the scale parameter characterizes the frequency. In the series of daughter wavelets, the scale parameter grows by powers of 2 (i.e., the \"length\" of the wavelet is \"stretched\" by a factor of 2). Consequently, the corresponding frequencies that daughter wavelets can detect decrease by half. The frequency spectrum of the mother wavelet is located at the high end of the frequency spectrum with the maximum frequency range. The frequency spectra of other daughter wavelets move towards the low-frequency end, and the frequency range they cover decreases accordingly. Ideally, all filters should overlap and cover each other.</p> <p></p> <p>Coverage of different scales of daughter wavelets on the wavelet frequency spectrum</p> <p>Yes, each daughter wavelet acts as a filter, and the process of discrete wavelet transform is a step-by-step filtering process.</p> <p>What is the specific procedure?</p> <p>In a nutshell: A set of discrete signals passes through a series of low-pass and high-pass filters, resulting in an approximate signal (denoted as A) and a detail signal (denoted as D).</p> <p>Describing it with an image:</p> <p></p> <p>LP stands for low-pass filter, HP stands for high-pass filter, B is the bandwidth, and 2B is twice the bandwidth.</p> <p>Illustrating it with an example:</p> <p>Filtering the original signal: The original signal consists of a continuous low-frequency sine wave (frequency 0.5) and two high-frequency (frequency 10) high-amplitude sine pulses randomly superimposed. Here, dB5 (Daubechies wavelet of the fifth order) is used as the mother wavelet for noise removal.</p> <p></p> <p>Original signal</p> <p>The result of the first-level wavelet decomposition is:</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate signal (low-pass result) of the first-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p></p> <p>Detail signal (high-pass result) of the first-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p>The result of the second-level wavelet decomposition (i.e., decomposing A1 signal):</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate signal (low-pass result) of the second-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p></p> <p>Detail signal (high-pass result) of the second-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p>The result of the third-level wavelet decomposition (i.e., decomposing A2 signal):</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate signal (low-pass result) of the third-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p></p> <p>Detail signal (high-pass result) of the third-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p>The result of the fourth-level wavelet decomposition (i.e., decomposing A3 signal):</p> <p></p> <p>Approximate signal (low-pass result) of the fourth-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p></p> <p>Detail signal (high-pass result) of the fourth-level wavelet decomposition</p> <p>At this point, we have obtained a good filtering result (i.e., A5). However, the pulse signal has also been filtered out. To preserve this signal, a threshold setting method can be used, but this is not elaborated here. It can be observed that the original signal has been filtered layer by layer, comprehensively and without omission, through high-pass and low-pass filtering.

From the perspective of frequency domain analysis, after a signal passes through a linear system, the spectrum of the output signal will be the product of the spectrum of the input signal and the system's transfer function. Certain frequency components in the transfer function have larger magnitudes. Therefore, these frequency components in the original signal will be enhanced, while other frequency components where the magnitudes are small or even zero will be attenuated or eliminated. Hence, the system's effect is equivalent to weighting the spectrum of the input signal.

It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principles are to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery. These principles also turn out to make the protocol ideal of the emerging \"machine-to-machine\" (M2M) or \"Internet of Things\" world of connected devices, and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.</p> </li> <li> <p>Publish/Subscribe: MQTT is based on a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Asynchronous: MQTT is an asynchronous protocol. An MQTT client can send a message and carry on with other processing, a message will be delivered to the client when it is available.</p> </li> <li> <p>QoS: MQTT supports three qualities of service for delivering messages between clients and servers: \"at most once\", \"at least once\" and \"exactly once\". It is possible to achieve reliability with the \"at least once\" or \"exactly once\" modes, but this is not the default. For example, a sensor might only need to send a reading when a value has changed but an actuator may need to receive every message to ensure it has the latest control information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retained Messages: MQTT supports retained messages. This is a useful feature of the MQTT protocol. It allows a client to publish a message that is stored by the server and sent to any future subscribers that subscribe to the matching topic. This is useful for messages such as status updates where a client can publish an update to a status topic and any new clients that connect will receive the most recent update.</p> </li> <li> <p>Small code footprint: The whole MQTT protocol specification is documented in about 30 pages of text. This makes it ideal for mobile devices such as cell phones, which need to keep their power usage down, or for embedded devices where memory is at a premium.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open protocol: MQTT is an open protocol, and as such is royalty free.
