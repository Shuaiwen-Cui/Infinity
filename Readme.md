## How To Deploy The Website To The Server

For deployment, you need to modify the deployment-related files first, namely, `upload.sh`, `win-upload.bat`, and `Ops.sh`. `upload.sh` and `win-upload.bat` are for uploading, where `upload.sh` can be used for all platforms, and `win-upload.bat` can only be used for Windows. `Ops.sh` is for server side operations, where you can use it to install packages, etc. Open these files, replace the repo link with your own repo link.

- For uploading

If you use MacOS or Linux, you can use the following command to upload the website to the server

```bash
bash upload.sh
```

If you use Windows, you can use the following command to upload the website to the server. This may require you to install git bash.

```bash
./upload.sh
```

if it does not work, you can use win-upload.bat

```bash
./win-upload.bat
```

- For server side operations

First, if this is the first time for deployment, you need to clone the repo to the server, use the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuaiwen-Cui/Infinity.git
```
change directory to the root directory of the website

```bash
cd <root directory of the website>
```

If the server is Linux, you can use the following command to do a series of operations on the server

```bash
bash Ops.sh
```

If the server is Windows, you can use the following command to do a series of operations on the server

```bash
./Ops.sh
```
