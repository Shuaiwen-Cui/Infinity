## How To Get Started

- For uploading

If you use MacOS or Linux, you can use the following command to upload the website to the server

```bash
bash upload.sh
```

If you use Windows, you can use the following command to upload the website to the server

```bash
./upload.sh
```

- For server side operations

First, if this is the first time for deployment, you need to clone the repo to the server, use the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuaiwen-Cui/Infinity.git
```
change directory to the root directory of the website

If the server is Linux, you can use the following command to do a series of operations on the server

```bash
bash Ops.sh
```

If the server is Windows, you can use the following command to do a series of operations on the server

```bash
./Ops.sh
```
