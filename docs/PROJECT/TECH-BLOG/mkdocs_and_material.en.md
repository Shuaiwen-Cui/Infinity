# Tech Blog Using MkDocs and Material Theme

## Introduction

For tech blog, one may don't want to use the traditional blog platform, such as WordPress, Blogger, etc. Instead, one may want to use a static site generator, which is much lightweight and easy to use. Popular static site generators include:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (My Pick)

- [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/)

- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/)

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

- [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)

- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/)

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

- [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)

- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

### What Is MkDocs?

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. It features a built-in development server that reloads your changes as you edit the source files, so you can see your changes instantly. MkDocs is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs/) and can be installed through pip.

### What Is Material Theme?

Material is a theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), an excellent static site generator geared towards project documentation. It is built using Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines. Material has been designed to be beautiful and easy to use. It comes with built-in support for [Material Design icons](https://material.io/icons/), [Material Design colours](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html), and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) fonts. Material is also fully responsive, meaning it looks great on desktop as well as mobile devices.

## How To Use MkDocs?

### Installation

MkDocs is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs/) and can be installed through pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

### Getting Started

Getting started is super easy. 

#### Step 1: Start a new project

```bash
mkdocs new my-project
```

This step will create a new project directory named `my-project` containing a single configuration file named `mkdocs.yml` and a folder named `docs` that will contain your documentation source files. Inside the `docs` directory, a new file named `index.md` will already exist. Open this file in your text editor. The folder structure should look like this:

```bash
my-project/
  mkdocs.yml
  docs/
    index.md
```

#### Step 2: Preview your site

```bash
cd my-project
mkdocs serve
```
This step will start the built-in dev-server, which will reload your documentation whenever anything changes. Open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, and you'll see the default home page being displayed. The dev-server also supports auto-reloading, and will rebuild your documentation whenever anything in the configuration file, documentation directory, or theme directory changes.

#### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This step is to build the documentation site. The documentation site will be located in the `site` directory, which can be copied to any standard web server for hosting.

!!! tip
    Note that, better build the website in the server rather than locally. That means, when uploading the website to the server, don't upload the `site` directory. For example, you can use gitignore to ignore the `site` directory. Then, in the server, in corresponding directory, run `mkdocs build` to build the website. 

### Configuration

The configuration file is named `mkdocs.yml`, and is located in the root of your project. The configuration file is a YAML file, with a simple structure. The configuration file contains a list of pages (in the `pages` key), a list of options (in the `site_name` key), and a list of pages to be excluded from the build (in the `exclude` key).

```yaml
site_name: My Project
site_description: A short description of my project.
site_author: Your Name
site_url: https://example.com
site_dir: site
site_favicon: images/favicon.ico
# ...
```

!!! tip
    For this part, if you use the material them later, you can directly use the template `mkdocs.yml` file in the `material` directory. Follow the instructions from Material for MkDocs to modify the configuration.

### Writing Documentation

The documentation files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. The documentation files are stored in the `docs` directory by default, but you can customize this using the `docs_dir` configuration parameter.

## How To Use Material Theme?

refer to [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), there is a very detailed documentation. 

### Installation

Material for MkDocs is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-material/) and can be installed through pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

To view your projects in real time, run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

if you get some errors reporting some modules not found, you can try to install them manually. Mainly due to the plugins, in my case, rss, minify, and i18n.
  
```bash
pip install mkdocs-rss-plugin
```

```bash
pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin
```

```bash
pip install mkdocs-static-i18n
```

### Configuration

This part should be paid attention to. I use my own configuration file as an example. Refer to the comments in the configuration file for details.

```yaml
# Project information
site_name: Eureka! # site name
site_url: https://localhost:8000/ # build and run on server, to visit it, type in the server's IP address and port number like this: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000

### Writing Documentation

For a tech blog, the contents matter the most, but I cannot help you with that. However, I can give a useful tip for you to make your article more beautiful.

!!! tip
    you can check the material theme documentation to study their markdown syntax.  

    Here are some useful syntax:

    - Note
    ```markdown
    !!! note
        This is a note.
    ```

    - Tip
    ```markdown
    !!! tip
        This is a tip.
    ```

    - Warning
    ```markdown
    !!! warning
        This is a warning.
    ```

    - Danger
    ```markdown
    !!! danger
        This is a danger.
    ```

    - Success
    ```markdown
    !!! success
        This is a success.
    ```
    - Info
    ```markdown
    !!! info
        This is an info.
    ```
    - Quote
    ```markdown
    !!! quote
        This is a quote.
    ```
    - Question
    ```markdown
    ??? question "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
        42.
    ```

## Upload And Deploy - Method 1 - Direct Upload To Server

### Upload

```bash
scp -r <local directory> <username>@<server address>:<remote directory>
```

### Deploy

```bash
cd <remote directory>
mkdocs build
```

### Mount To Nginx

Before mounting to Nginx, you need to install Nginx first.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
Then, you need to modify the configuration file of Nginx.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Enter the following file, press `i` to enter insert mode, and modify the file as follows:

```bash
server {
    listen 80; # by default, the port is 80 # if you use other port (e.g., 8000), you need to specify it here. Accordingly, when you visit the website, you need to type in the port number like this: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000
    server_name <server address>; # name as you like
    root <remote directory>/site; # the site folder is where the built website is located
    index index.html index.htm;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
Then, press `esc` to exit insert mode, and type in `:wq` to save and exit.

Finally, restart Nginx.

```bash
sudo nginx -t # test
sudo systemctl restart nginx # restart nginx
```

## Upload And Deploy - Method 2 - Upload To GitHub And Deploy To Server (Recommended)

If you are familiar with git & github, this method is recommended.

I assume you have already link your local repo to the remote repo on GitHub. If not, please refer to [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) to create a repo and link it to your local repo.

!!! tip
    Note that, better build the website in the server rather than locally. That means, when uploading the website to the server, don't upload the `site` directory. For example, you can use gitignore to ignore the `site` directory. Then, in the server, in corresponding directory, run `mkdocs build` to build the website.

    To use a gitignore file, you can create a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your repo. Then, you can add the following content to the file:

    ```bash
    # Ignore site directory
    site/
    ```

### Upload

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push origin master # or it can be 'git push origin main'
```
If you use github pages to host your website, you can use optionally use the following command to push the website to the gh-pages branch.

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

!!! tip
    For me, I have a .sh file to do this. You can refer to the `upload.sh` file in this repo. You can modify it as you like. Then, you can use the following command to upload the website to the server.

    ```bash
    ./upload.sh # for Windows
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    sh upload.sh # for Linux
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    bash upload.sh # for Linux
    ```
    
### Deploy

On the server, you need to pull the repo and build the website.

If this is the first time you pull the repo, you need to clone the repo first.

```bash
git clone <repo url>
```

Otherwise, you can pull the repo.

```bash
git pull
```

Then, enter the repo directory, and build the website.

```bash
cd <repo directory>
```

Then, build the website.

```bash
mkdocs build
```

Finally, mount to Nginx. Please refer to the previous section in Method 1.

## The End

Enjoy your website!
