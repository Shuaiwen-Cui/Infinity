    Everything starts with simplicity and ends up with simplicity. Simplicity is beauty and power.

There are too many fancy tutorials, but too few simple ones. The right way to learn is step by step. Start with simple things and then gradually go deeper. Here are some tutorials suitable for beginners. I hope they can help you get started quickly.
