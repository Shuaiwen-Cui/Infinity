# Compound Types

Say you’ve developed a computer game called User-Hostile in which players match wits with a cryptic and abusive computer interface. Now you must write a program that keeps track of your monthly game sales for a five-year period. Or you want to inventory your accumulation of hacker-hero trading cards.You soon conclude that you need something more than C++’s simple basic types to meet these data requirements,and C++
offers something more—compound types.These are types built from the basic integer and floating-point types.The most far-reaching compound type is the class, that bastion
of OOP toward which we are progressing. But C++ also supports several more modest compound types taken from C.The array, for example, can hold several values of the same
type.A particular kind of array can hold a string, which is a series of characters. Structures can hold several values of differing types.Then there are pointers, which are variables that tell a computer where data is placed.You’ll examine all these compound forms (excepclasses) in this chapter, take a first look at new and delete and how you can use them to manage data,and take an introductory look at the C++ string class, which gives you an alternative way to work with strings.

## Introducing Arrays

!!! note
    An array is a data form that can hold several values,all of one type.

To create an array, you use a declaration statement.An array declaration should indicate three things:
- The type of value to be stored in each element
- The name of the array
- The number of elements in the array

This is the general form for declaring an array:
```cpp
typeName arrayName[arraySize];
```
Much of the usefulness of the array comes from the fact that you can access array elements individually.The way to do this is to use a subscript, or an index, to number the elements. C++ array numbering starts with zero.

Listing 4.1 arrayone.cpp

```cpp
// arrayone.cpp -- small arrays of integers
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    int yams[3]; // creates array with three elements
    yams[0] = 7; // assign value to first element
    yams[1] = 8; // assign value to second element
    yams[2] = 6; // assign value to third element

    int yamcosts[3] = {20, 30, 5}; // create, initialize array

    cout << "Total yams = ";
    cout << yams[0] + yams[1] + yams[2] << endl;
    cout << "The package with " << yams[1] << " yams costs ";
    cout << yamcosts[1] << " cents per yam.\n";
    int total = yams[0] * yamcosts[0] + yams[1] * yamcosts[1];
    total = total + yams[2] * yamcosts[2];
    cout << "The total yam expense is " << total << " cents.\n";

    cout << "\nSize of yams array = " << sizeof yams;
    cout << " bytes.\n";
    cout << "Size of one element = " << sizeof yams[0];
    cout << " bytes.\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Initialization Rules for Arrays
You can use the initialization form only when defining the array.You cannot use it later,and you cannot assign one array wholesale to another.However, you can use subscripts and assign values to the elements of an array individually.

If you partially initialize an array, the compiler sets the remaining elements to zero. 

!!! tip
    It’s easy to initialize all the elements of an array to zero—just explicitly initialize the first element to zero and then let the compiler initialize the remaining elements to zero.
