## Version Control System (VCS)

VCS is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. There are two types of VCS: Centralized and Distributed. Git is a Distributed VCS, very popular and widely used.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
