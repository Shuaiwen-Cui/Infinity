# Embedded Systems Basics

!!! tip
    The recommended learning sequence for this section is as follows:

    - Start with a simple introduction to embedded systems to understand the basic concepts.
  
    - Watch the JUST 51 microcontroller tutorial to learn about register development.
  
    - Watch the JUST 32-bit microcontroller tutorial to learn about standard library development.
  
    - Watch the Youngtalk Electronics 103 series tutorial to learn about KEIL+HAL library development.
  
    - Watch the Youngtalk Electronics IoT series tutorial to learn about CubeIDE+HAL library development, as well as IoT-related knowledge.
  
    - Watch the Youngtalk Electronics F407 series tutorial to learn advanced STM32 development content.
  
    - If you lack hardware basics, you can watch the Youngtalk "Fall in Love with Breadboard" series content.

## What is Embedded Systems?

## Introduction to Embedded Systems

An **embedded system** is a special-purpose computer system designed for a specific application. It is embedded in a larger device or system, providing control, monitoring, or communication functions.

**Characteristics:**

* Dedicated function: Embedded systems typically perform only a specific function, unlike general-purpose computers that have a variety of functions.
* Real-time performance: They have high timing requirements and need to complete tasks within a specified time frame.
* Embeddedness: They are embedded in other devices or systems and become an integral part of them.
* Limited resources: They are constrained in terms of cost, power consumption, size, etc.

**Application areas:**

Embedded systems are used in almost all modern electronic devices, including:

* Consumer electronics: mobile phones, TVs, cameras, MP3 players, etc.
* Industrial control: robots, CNC machine tools, instruments and meters, etc.
* Communication equipment: routers, switches, base stations, etc.
* Automotive electronics: car navigation, safety systems, entertainment systems, etc.
* Medical equipment: monitors, respirators, CT scanners, etc.
* Aerospace: airplanes, satellites, missiles, etc.

**Components:**

An embedded system typically consists of the following components:

* Hardware: processor, memory, peripherals, etc.
* Software: operating system, application software

**Development:**

The development of embedded systems requires considering both hardware and software aspects, and involves more complex knowledge and technologies.

## MCU, DSP, MPU, SoC, SoPC

**MCU** (Microcontroller Unit): A microcontroller is a chip that integrates a processor, memory, and peripherals, and is typically used in control applications.

**DSP** (Digital Signal Processor): A digital signal processor is a chip specifically designed for digital signal processing and is typically used in audio, video, and other fields.

**MPU** (Microprocessor Unit): A microprocessor is a chip that only contains a processor core and typically requires external memory, peripherals, etc.

**SoC** (System on Chip): A system on chip is a chip that integrates a processor core, memory, peripherals, etc.

**SoPC** (System on Programmable Chip): A system on programmable chip is a chip that integrates a processor core, programmable logic, memory, peripherals, etc.

!!! note
    The core tenet of embedded development is:
    To develop the most cost-effective product with the most suitable performance, functionality, and cost.
