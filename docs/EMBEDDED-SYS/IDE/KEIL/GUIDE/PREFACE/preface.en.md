## Chapter Overview

The book starts with the installation of MDK and describes the software components along with complete workflow from starting a project up to debugging on hardware. It contains the following chapters:

**MDK Introduction** provides an overview about the MDK Tools, the software packs, and describes the product installation along with the use of example projects.

**CMSIS** is a software framework for embedded applications that run on Cortex-M based microcontrollers. It provides consistent software interfaces and hardware abstraction layers that simplify software reuse.

**Software Components** enable retargeting of I/O functions for various standard I/O channels and add board support for a wide range of evaluation boards.

**Create Applications** guides you towards creating and modifying projects using CMSIS and device-related software components. A hands-on tutorial shows the main configuration dialogs for setting tool options.

**Debug Applications** describes the process of debugging applications on real hardware and explains how to connect to development boards using a wide range of debug adapters.

**MDK-Middleware** gives an overview of the middleware components available for users of the MDK-Professional and MDK-Plus editions. It also explains how to create applications that use the MDK-Middleware and contains essential tips and tricks to get you started quickly.
