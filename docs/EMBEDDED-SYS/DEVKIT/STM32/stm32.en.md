## Nucleo or Discovery or Eval Board?
The official boards are categorized into three families depending on the particular microcontroller on the board, namely STM32 Nucleo, Discovery, and Eval Board. Beginners may feel confused about the difference between Nucleo, Discovery, and Eval Board. Here is a brief introduction.

-  **Nucleo**: A series of low-cost development boards with Arduino-compatible connectors and ST Morpho connectors. It is designed for quick prototyping and evaluation, and it is equipped with Arduino UNO R3 or ST Morpho connectors. It is a good choice for beginners.
-  **Discovery**: A series of development boards with a variety of features, including sensors, audio, and graphics. It is designed for quick prototyping and evaluation, and it is equipped with Arduino UNO R3 or ST Morpho connectors. It is a good choice for beginners.
-  **Eval Board**: A series of development boards with a variety of features, including sensors, audio, and graphics. It is designed for quick prototyping and evaluation, and it is equipped with Arduino UNO R3 or ST Morpho connectors. It is a good choice for beginners.

## MCU or MPU?

Beginners may also feel confused about the difference between MCU and MPU. Here is a brief introduction.

-  **MCU**: Microcontroller Unit, a single chip that integrates a microprocessor core, memory, and peripherals. It is designed for embedded applications.
-  **MPU**: Microprocessor Unit, a single chip that integrates a microprocessor core and memory. It is designed for general-purpose applications.

In short, MCU is usually less powerful and cheaper than MPU. MCU is designed for embedded applications, while MPU is designed for general-purpose applications. MCU is usually used in embedded systems, while MPU is usually used in personal computers. MCU -> MPU, better follow this order.
