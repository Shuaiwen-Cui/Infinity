## ESPRESSIF SYSTEMS & ESPRESSIF IOT DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK (ESP-IDF)

!!! info
    **Espressif Systems** is a semiconductor company based in China, known for developing low-power wireless solutions, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules and SoCs (System on Chips). Their products, such as the ESP8266 and ESP32 series, have gained popularity in IoT, embedded systems, and wireless communication due to their low cost, power efficiency, and ease of use. Espressif provides a range of development tools and software support, making their products widely adopted by developers and engineers in various industries.

!!! info
    **ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)** is the official development framework for the ESP32 series chips from Espressif. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to help developers create robust applications for ESP32-based devices. ESP-IDF supports FreeRTOS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a wide range of peripherals. It is compatible with the GCC toolchain and supports multiple languages like C and C++. The framework includes components for networking, security, power management, and driver development, making it suitable for a wide range of IoT applications.

!!! note
    There are two ways to use ESP-IDF: **ESP-IDF Command Prompt** and **GUI-based IDEs** like Visual Studio Code. The latter is the most popular way to use ESP-IDF.

## SETUP

!!! note
    In terms of interfacing manner, there are three ways to use ESP-IDF:

    - ESP-IDF Command Prompt: This is the default way to use ESP-IDF. It is a command-line interface that provides access to the tools and utilities required for ESP-IDF development.

    - ESP-IDF IDE: This is an integrated development environment that provides a graphical interface for ESP-IDF development. It includes tools like the ESP-IDF Command Prompt, a text editor, and a project manager.

    - IDE Plugins: These are plugins that integrate ESP-IDF with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. They provide features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging support. This is the most popular way to use ESP-IDF.
